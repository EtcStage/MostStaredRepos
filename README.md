in this project i used Volley library which is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster.

Volley offers the following benefits:

   - Automatic scheduling of network requests.
   - Multiple concurrent network connections.
   - Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
   - Support for request prioritization.
   - Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
   - Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff.
   - Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
   - Debugging and tracing tools.
